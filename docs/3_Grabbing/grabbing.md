## Overview
The Grabbing Room is meant to visualise the concepts around designing for user interaction in VR.
The most common interaction would often be grabbing of objects, hence the importance of understanding design principles
around grabbing and interaction with objects.

## Designing for Height
VR users can use programmes sitting or standing, and VR affords a wide range of movement, but it is still important to
make the movement comfortable. It is thus good to constrain design to the user's own physical constraints, or even the
VR headset's technical constraints (such as keeping within tracking range of some VR sets).

As such, a few concepts are explored in this room.
### Height of Interactables
To summarise the best practices found online (See [References](#height-ref)), the following are some guidelines to follow:

- Keep interactable objects between desk (1m) to eye-level height.
- Design for standing or sitting users. You should decide beforehand if your user should be standing or sitting.
  - You can guide user's behaviour through built-in constraints. *Example: angled screens that can be viewed while standing
	but not while sitting.*
