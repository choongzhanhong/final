## Overview
The UI Height Room is designed for users to understand and get used to the basic interactions and of objects in a VR environment through and immersive and gamified process. In addition, as an extra layer of authenticity in the VR environment, users can only interact with objects that are eye level or below which helps to create a more immersive experience and reduce the motion sickness that might occur in using VR.

## Process
Users will be presented with two sets of paintings on the left and right side of the wall, together with a instruction/scenario to explain what the users should do. After looking at the correct painting on the left wall, users would then need to place the painting on the right to the same order. The red light above the painting will turn to green, once the correct painting is put at the correct order.

## Basic VR Interactions
Designing a VR interaction can be very different with designing any other virtual applications. Hence, through this experience, users are able to learn how to design VR interactions.

## Interaction Design
Basic VR interaction design focuses on creating a seamless and intuitive experience for users within the virtual environment. To achieve this, we must keep in mind several key principles, including ensuring that no movement takes place unless it is user-driven, enabling users to interact with objects even if they are occluded by their hands, restricting unnecessary movements within the virtual environment to prevent motion sickness, not instigating any movement without user input, and reducing neck strain by encouraging users to look around without requiring rapid head movements. By following these principles, we can create VR experiences that are comfortable, engaging, and immersive for users.

## Ideal Height Range
When designing VR interactions, it's important to consider the placement of interactive elements within the virtual environment. Interactive objects placed at desk height or below can cause poor tracking due to infrared-reflective objects, while objects placed above eye level can cause neck strain and occlusion issues. We should be aware of these potential issues and use techniques such as compensating for hand-occlusion to ensure a comfortable and seamless user experience. By carefully considering the placement of interactive elements, we can create VR experiences that are intuitive, engaging, and free from common design pitfalls.
