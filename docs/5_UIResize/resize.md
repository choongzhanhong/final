## Overview
The UI Resize Room is designed to demonstrate the importance of UI size in VR space. Users will be able to adjust the size of UI panels and observe how the changes affect user experience. There will be a hands-on opportunity for users to manipulate the size of the UI elements to gain a better understanding of the relation between user experience and UI size.

## Process
Users will undergo a short tutorial consisting of explanations and a summary of the theories behind the relation between user experience and UI size. Following that, they are provided with a freespace to adjust the size of the UI board and font to see the relation between the two. Lastly, they will have a mini-game password panel which will allow how a bad UI could affect user experience directly. 

## Effect of VR UI size on user
Fitts' law suggests that size of UI (User Interface) and its elements causes a significant impact on user interaction. In traditional 2D settings, larger UI elements generally has better interactivity and accessibility to the users, and maximizing the size of the UI was deemed to be better for experience. However, in VR settings, users have an environment that extends beyond their normal field of view, and larger UI may not necessarily be better. Large UI could potentially cause additional eye or head movements to view them, leading to discomfort or even motion sickness to the user especially if the UI is horizontally elongated or contains a lot of text. As such, size should be considered by a designer when designing user interfaces in VR space; bigger is not necessarily better.
