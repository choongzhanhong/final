## Overview
Designing user interfaces (UI) in virtual reality (VR) presents a unique challenge due to the added dimension of depth. To create a seamless and intuitive experience, designers must carefully consider the distance between the user and the UI elements. The UI Distance Room is an educational resource that helps users understand this crucial factor and how to effectively position UI elements in a VR environment. Through this resource, users can gain valuable insights and techniques for creating engaging and user-friendly VR experiences.

## Distance
The placement of objects in virtual environments is a critical aspect of designing an effective and immersive VR experience. To achieve optimal results, designers must carefully consider the sense of depth when placing objects in the virtual space. If objects are placed too far from the user, it can result in a loss of stereoscopic effect, which diminishes the sense of immersion. Conversely, if objects are placed too close to the user, it can lead to cross-eyes and double vision, causing discomfort and eye strain. While there are varying opinions about the appropriate distance to place an object or UI, it's essential to consider multiple factors, including the user's comfort and visual experience. By thoughtfully balancing depth and placement, designers can create VR environments that are both engaging and comfortable for users. 

### Distance from user
When it comes to selecting objects in VR, precision is key. To ensure high accuracy, it's best to position 3D selection tasks close to the user's eyes. Additionally, Oculus VR (2015a) recommends placing UI elements at a distance between 1 to 3 meters from the user for optimal visibility and usability. By positioning UI elements within this range, designers can enhance the user's visual experience and ensure that interactions with the interface are both efficient and effective.

### Curved UI
The field of view (FOV) is an essential aspect of creating an immersive VR experience. A lower FOV can decrease immersion and result in a "tunnel vision" effect, limiting the user's sense of presence within the virtual environment. Conversely, a higher FOV can decrease resolution and introduce distortion, compromising the visual quality of the VR experience. Finding the optimal FOV is critical to creating a seamless and engaging VR environment that balances immersion with visual quality. By carefully adjusting the FOV to match the intended user experience, designers can ensure that users are fully immersed in the virtual world without sacrificing visual clarity.

## Disclaimer
While distance is certainly an important consideration when designing and positioning a UI in VR, it's not the only factor to take into account. In fact, there are several other factors that can impact the effectiveness and user-friendliness of a UI in VR. In addition to the UI Distance Room, be sure to explore the [UI Height]() and [UI Resize]() rooms for insights into other key factors that can influence the design and placement of UI elements. By understanding and applying these best practices, you can create VR experiences that are not only visually stunning but also highly functional and intuitive.
