## Overview
The Grabbing Room is meant to embody the concepts around designing for user interaction in VR.
The most common interaction would often be grabbing of objects, hence the importance of understanding design principles around grabbing and interaction with objects.

## Designing for Height
VR users can use programmes sitting or standing, and VR affords a wide range of movement, but it is still important to make the movement comfortable. It is thus good to constrain design to the user's own physical constraints, or even the VR headset's technical constraints (such as keeping within tracking range of some VR sets).

### Height of Interactables
To summarise the best practices found online (See [References](#height-ref)), the following are some guidelines to follow:

- Keep interactable objects between **desk (1m) to eye-level height**.
	- Eye-level and above elements are generally for viewing only, with interactions near desk or elbow level.
- Design for standing or sitting users. You can decide beforehand if your user should be standing or sitting.
  - You can guide user's behaviour through built-in constraints. *Example: angled screens that can be viewed while standing but not while sitting.*

## Affordances for Interaction
It is important to distinguish interactable objects from environmental or cosmetic elements. In scenarios such as games, this gives the user an intuitive grasp of what actions they can take. Your program should thus indicate to the user what are the *affordances* of the objects around them.

### Outlines
A very simple way to indicate such affordances is through outlining your objects to make them stand out. In my scene, I made use of a free and super comprehensive asset that comes with a variety of outline styles.

To name a few, you can outline objects if they're visible/hidden, or even show a silhouette when it's behind a wall. So,
there's many ways to provide outlines in different scenarios. Imagine: you would want less visible outlines in a puzzle game
(to not make things too obvious) or to make your scene more immersive/less visually cluttered.

### Varied Affordances
Apart from interactions with 3D objects, the user can sometimes interact with UI as well. Our entire project allows users to interact with UI using a laser pointer as an indicator. This scene helps to point out the fact that we can differentiate UI from 3D game objects using different indicators.

### Crosshairs and Others
When designing multiple interactions, you may require different indicators. As an example, you may want to indicate something is grabbable and another thing is interactable (like an object vs a lever). Or, something is grabbable from a distance and another is only grabbable physically. Aside from outlines, you can also use things like crosshairs or changing colour of objects to make them stand out!
